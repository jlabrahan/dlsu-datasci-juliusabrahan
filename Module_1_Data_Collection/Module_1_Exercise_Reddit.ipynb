At the end I have decided for Mavericks because players looked more promising than Bulls squad. Also I guess there is some Czech population in Texas. I like Doncic a lot, but have no idea, where could I buy the dress, Jersey. Also, which good read about team would You recommend, Any YouTube's focused on team or blogs. I will be very grateful for any information you will provide as well as something interesting about team, players, history or so. I hope it'll be a good time, as I'm not connected to any city in USA it was pretty hard for me to decide. But the players really have my sympathies, team looks good. Greetings from Czechia and have a great evening everyone\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Has anybody ever purchased a custom jersey with the NBA store?  How was your experience?  The main reason I’m asking is because there are a few players that have played for Dallas that I really regret not purchasing their jerseys during their time here.  I figured I could try to simply just recreate their jersey using the custom one from NBA store.  I’m just worried the name wouldn’t be formatted or spaced accurately to the player’s official jersey.  Any input or advice is greatly appreciated!\\n\\nIn case you’re wondering, the players in question would be Shawn Marion and Vince Carter.',\n",

Porzingis is good with mid range jumpers and Luka is good at posting up smaller players. But other than that, I feel at times the offense is stagnant.

       "   'selftext': 'Although the finals is a longshot this year i think with a fully healthy team (especially if WCS plays) i think we were a dark horse for the finals. Porzingis was looking as good as ever and  luka will be healthy. That’s not even mentioning what makes this team so good and why i love them so much. The all star talent with great role players and a lot on great contracts. All the players seem to really get along well and look like they have great chemistry while still being very focused on winning and keeping it serious when needed. It’s just a great personality mix but everyone’s main goal is winning so they all buy into the system and the coach is good too so it’s set up really well. I’ve been ranting so i’ll end this on my main point: Although i feel like some unfortunate events led to us not being able to reach our full potential this year it’s okay because this year wasn’t our year anyways. We will keep getting better for years to come and will always have a chance at an upset year. On top of all that I have a lot of trust in the players and executives to make the right decisions going forward for the betterment of the team.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nMFFL',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Warriors fan here with a bit of an observation on Luka. It's clear how well he moves off all and how high of an IQ he has. Watching his chemistry with Seth is really eye-opening for how he might play with another high level ball handler on the court. I think if you could find an upgrade for the position and take some of the playmaking responsibilities from Luka, you could unlock Luka in the short roll similar to how we use Draymond with Steph. Given Luka's playmaking he could hit any pass, probably make any finish, and still be able to pop out for three. The Steph Draymond p&amp;r broke the league for a couple years because if this action. If you guys can get an all star caliber guard to run this action with Luka I have no idea how unstoppable it would be. Anyways GL in the playoffs I'll be rooting for you guys 👍\",\n",

There wasn’t a blueprint. Or a timeframe. Certainly there was more concern and doubt than hope.\\n\\nOn the night of March 11, the Mavericks and the rest of the NBA plunged headfirst into coronavirus chaos. The season abruptly was suspended “until further notice.”\\n\\nOne hundred and thirty days later here we are, the Mavericks and 21 other teams encamped in this Disney World bubble, attempting to restart the season even as the coronavirus rages on with increasing intensity.\\n\\nHow the Mavericks made it from March 11 to the bubble relatively whole is a triumph in itself. The backstory is crazy. The steps were complex and painstaking. Clearly expensive, too, although the man footing the bill insists he hasn’t so much as peeked at the still-climbing tab.\\n\\n“I honestly don’t know,” owner Mark Cuban said. “I have no idea. I told them to do everything the right way, with the guys’ mental and physical health ahead of everything.\\n\\n“I’m truly afraid to look at the Mavs financials, so I haven’t. I know it sounds crazy, but it is true.”\\n\\nTo reconstruct the past four months’ jagged timeline, *The News* spoke to Mavericks staff members who are most responsible for the players’ health and performance guidance -- staffers who Cuban says were instrumental in navigating the 35-member travel party to bubble life.\\n\\nYes, the NBA, its health experts and the National Basketball Players Association collaborated on 100-plus pages of return-to-play guidelines and protocols. Yes, the NBA reportedly spent north of $150 million to create this closed-campus, no-fans, few-reporters bubble effect.\\n\\nBut all 21 markets represented here (including L.A.‘s two franchises) had unique challenges, varying virus-spread rates and government regulations.\\n\\nAfter every franchise re-opened training facilities and players returned for individual workouts in June, the Nets, Nuggets, Bucks, Heat, Clippers and Kings had to shut down due to virus outbreaks.\\n\\n“A big, really important aspect of this for us was the seven or eight weeks when our facility opened and we were able to have individual workouts,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said.\\n\\nHe singled out director of player health and performance Casey Smith, head athletic trainer Dionne Calhoun, assistant athletic trainer Heather Mau and athletic performance director Jeremy Holsopple.\\n\\n“All did a phenomenal job of not only following the procedures and protocols, but also keeping an element of positivity and excitement about getting back in the gym.”\\n\\nAs an example, Carlisle cited the process of entering the facility. He described a device into which each person was required to step. In the device was a quarter-inch of water that cleansed shoes.\\n\\n“Then you’d step on some towels, dry them off, and then you’d go to a station where you have another set of shoes from inside, change into those,” he said. “Get your temperature taken. You fill out a questionnaire. You wash your hands and then you get into your workout.”\\n\\nThat is just one snippet of resourcefulness that Smith says was planned and implemented not only by those Carlisle mentioned, but equipment manager Kory Johnson and assistant equipment manager Craig Metcalfe; manual therapist Casey Spangler; physical therapist Manolo Valdivieso; assistant strength coaches Jace Fredenburg and Meg Dodge; director of mental skills Don Kalkstein and athletic performance intern Raphael Whittingham.\\n\\n“The entire Mavs training and support staff has been incredible,” Cuban said. “I can’t thank them enough and there aren’t enough superlatives to describe the work and effort required to get us to Orlando and keep everyone in the right place mentally and physically.\\n\\n“This whole effort from everyone has been extraordinary.”\\n\\n**The early weeks**\\n\\nDallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic practices free throws from the first mandatory workout on July 1, 2020. Doncic and others played at the team\\'s practice facility for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic started in Dallas, Tex. (Photo courtesy Dallas Mavericks)(Dallas Mavericks)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSmith said the first days of the hiatus were spent in NBA-organized committee meetings.\\n\\nDiscussions, Smith said, mainly focused on three areas as the NBA studied whether a return to play was plausible: Logistical, medical and performance.\\n\\nFrom logistical and performance standpoints, the committees studied the labor lockouts of 1998 and 2011 that shortened those seasons while prolonging players’ off-seasons.\\n\\n“But also we were trying to keep up with the medicine side of the virus,” Smith said. “And it continues to emerge, so that’s an ongoing challenge.”\\n\\nWhen the hiatus began, the Mavericks’ medical and training staffs maintained daily dialogue with the players. The shutdown of all NBA training facilities and Dallas County’s stay-home, stay-safe orders made training a challenge.\\n\\n“Once we realized this wasn’t just a two-week thing, we had to scramble quickly to order as much equipment as we could get,” Holsopple said. “It seemed like once everyone else in the world realized what was going on, everyone was scooping up equipment.”\\n\\nSmith and Holsopple borrowed equipment from the Mavericks’ weight rooms at American Airlines Center and training facility. They ordered training bikes, medicine balls, resistance-bands power-blocks that act as dumbbells.\\n\\nHolsopple and Smith personally sanitized and delivered the items to players’ homes, including Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis prior to their returns to Europe later in the pandemic.\\n\\n“I’d fill up my car and I’d go to Luka’s house and drop off bikes, dumbbells, benches, kettle bells,” Holsopple said, adding that Porzingis’ delivery was more arduous because the 7-3 center lives in a high-rise.\\n\\nTwo Mavericks were rehabilitating from surgeries and required in-person physical therapy. After getting league approval, Smith worked with Dwight Powell at AAC and Calhoun worked with Jalen Brunson at the training facility while wearing PPE and maintaining social distancing.\\n\\nThe rest of the Mavericks had to work out at their homes with no in-person supervision. Fortunately for the Mavericks, they already had a training app into which Holsopple loads personalized regimens for each player, with videos of how to perform each task.\\n\\n“That helped a lot,” Holsopple said. “A lot of my counterparts that I was talking to, they didn’t have that type of thing. They work in Excel or Word document or something. They were trying to figure out how to best manage the hiatus remotely.”\\n\\nHow much did the home training help Mavericks players? Allow center Boban Marjanovic to elaborate.\\n\\n“Our strength coaches did a great job with all the equipment they sent us,” he said. “Peloton, Nordic(Track. . . So far, when we come on the court, we don’t feel like, ‘Oh, we don’t have pain in legs; pain in back.’ We’re just ready to play.”\\n\\n**Facility opens**\\n\\nThe Mavericks were among the last NBA teams to reopen their training facility, on May 28, for limited individual workouts, “out of an abundance of caution,” Smith says.\\n\\nThe medical, training and equipment staffs were well-prepared -- with scheduling, social distancing and sanitizing protocols.\\n\\nThe training facility’s locker room, showers, hot and cold tubs and steam room and coaches’ offices remained closed. Players had to bring their own workout gear and disinfect and change shoes upon entering.\\n\\nPlayer were consulted about preferred training times. Smith organized color-coded daily schedules that were emailed to players. The staff tried to keep the same player-trainer tandems intact, and trainers wore gloves and masks.\\n\\nBetween each session there was sanitizing – lots of it. Smith purchased several professional-grade sprayers, like the ones exterminators use. The Mavericks bought scads of Husky 891 Arena Disinfectant, which sell for $94 for a case of four.\\n\\n“The volume that we needed, it’s not like we were giving it a little spritz,” Holsopple said. “We were drowning some of the \\\\[weight\\\\] equipment because there’s little crevices that any virus could be in. We just can’t have that be the case.”\\n\\nEquipment managers Johnson and Metcalfe worked separate shifts because the days were long. One of their primary responsibilities was spraying down the backboards, stanchions and wall padding.\\n\\nIt also was their responsibility to sanitize the basketballs. Initially they followed the advice of Spalding and used dish soap and hot water. When that proved inefficient they used Lysol wipes. Ultimately they chose to spray the balls with Husky 891.\\n\\nAnd in case a day of spraying and wiping the facility wasn’t enough: Every evening a company that specializes in hospital sanitation sent a crew for extra-deep cleaning.\\n\\n**Packing for the bubble**\\n\\nOn June 29, employing the same moving company the Cowboys use for training camp in Oxnard, the Mavericks sent a large truck of supplies to the Disney World bubble.\\n\\nThe NBA specified that supply trucks reach the bubble no sooner 8 a.m. on July 1. Each had to be unloaded into teams’ corresponding resort rooms by 10 p.m. on July 2 – five days before the first wave of teams arrived on the Disney World campus.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n“So the rooms could be sterilized and all the equipment had time to quarantine,” Smith said. “If we had movers moving in weight equipment there needed to be a certain number of days pass that the equipment not have live viral bodies on it.”\\n\\nOh.\\n\\nThe Mavericks had the furniture removed from two adjacent 400-square-foot rooms on the players’ floor. Each room has weights and other apparatuses that aid in strength and recovery.\\n\\n“We can actually leave those doors open because there’s security everywhere,” Holsopple said. “They’re just walk-in weight rooms the players can use any time.”\\n\\nThat is in addition to the weight rooms in the practice facilities attached to the three arenas on campus.\\n\\n“I’m not a big butt-kisser,” Smith said, “but I’m supremely impressed with the work the NBA has done. It’s an amazing setup. The gyms. The weight rooms they have here at the practice gyms. The training rooms. It’s truly amazing the work they put into this.”In most seasons, the longest Mavericks road trip is five or six days. For this bubble stay, Dallas arrived on July 8 and provided it qualifies for the playoffs will be here a minimum of seven weeks – longer if it advances past the first round.\\n\\nThat made the sending the truckload of supplies ahead of time all the more helpful, though not entirely convenient.\\n\\nHelpful because items like Carlisle’s and J.J. Barea’s golf clubs and Seth Curry’s gaming system were waiting in their rooms when the team arrived.\\n\\nDifficult because the training and medical staffs had to organize supplies and pack the truck between player workouts and cleansing at the practice facility in Dallas.\\n\\n“Any time you were not with a player, you’re either planning or packing or ordering,” Holsopple said. “The amount of planning in itself is staggering.”\\n\\nExample: Each Maverick takes individually-targeted nutritional supplements. Some also take collagen and vitamin C for tendon recovery and beet juice probiotics.\\n\\nFor each player, Holsopple had to fill and label individualized plastic baggy for each potential day the player might be in the bubble – 90 days. That’s more than 1,000 individually labeled baggies.\\n\\n“That took a looonng time,” Holsopple said with a laugh.\\n\\nFortunately, that reported $150 million the NBA spent is making life easier for everyone in the bubble. Or at least making work more convenient for teams’ support-staff members.\\n\\nA few nights ago while speaking to *The News* by telephone, Mavericks equipment manager Johnson was in the indoor batting and pitching facility that the Atlanta Braves once used for spring training at Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports campus.\\n\\nJohnson wasn’t limbering his arm or taking BP. He was there to wash the Mavericks’ practice gear, utilizing some of the [**66 washers and 66 dryers installed by the NBA for equipment managers to use.**](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCgkY7zpapI/?utm_source=ig_embed)\\n\\n“They ran plumbing for the washers and venting for the dryers and put in AC for us,” Johnson marveled. “They spared no expense.”\\n\\nSometimes, though, personal touches are needed, especially for a stay of this length. That is why Holsopple ordered a PartyBox 1000, a large speaker with lights on which Mavericks players can play their favorite music during practices, shootarounds and weight-lifting sessions.\\n\\nThe Mavericks already have a PartyBox 1000 for their practice facility and another at AAC, but in these pandemic times, Holsopple reasoned that it would be more efficient and sanitary to have a new one shipped to the bubble.\\n\\n“People say, ‘Hey, they get paid millions of dollars; they should enjoy what they’re doing,’ \" Holsopple said. “But the reality is its human nature for things to get monotonous. You’ve got to figure out how to not let things get stagnant.”\\n\\nPartyBox 1000s sell online for $1,299, but not to worry, Mr. Cuban. Holsopple ordered through Amazon. You probably have Prime.\\n\\nWhich means shipping probably was free.\\n\\n**Trey Burke too:** As many fans, and reporters, suspected, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist isn’t the only Maverick who is not with the team in the bubble.\\n\\nNone of the Mavericks-produced videos of players practicing or doing recreational activities have included guard Trey Burke, whom the Mavericks signed on July 1 to fill the roster spot vacated when Willie Cauley-Stein opted to not take part in the season-restart.\\n\\nEarlier this week Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle confirmed that Kidd-Gilchrist is not in the bubble, nor is guard Jalen Brunson, who originally planned to continue his shoulder-surgery rehab in the bubble.\\n\\nAfter Saturday’s practice, Carlisle confirmed that Burke also is not with the team.\\n\\n“It’s logistics,” Carlisle said. “That’s about what I can tell you on that. I do think we’re closer to getting those guys (Kidd-Gilchrist and Burke) here, but beyond that I really can’t say anything else because of stipulations and regulations.”\\n\\nCarlisle perhaps was referring to HIPAA and NBA collective-bargaining regulations that limit how much franchises can say about injured or ill players’ absences.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'OK, so this first scrimmage made something pretty clear to me -- Boban can\\'t really play on the 2nd unit \"straight up\".\\n\\nJJ (and Wright?) can\\'t penetrate the defense (and create shots) without a pick from an athletic big lob threat, so the ball just bounces around on the perimeter until somebody has to jack up an inefficient shot. Also, this completely wastes Kleber, who can play as that athletic big, but because Boban has to stay inside, Kleber is  stuck on the perimeter, and since the guards can\\'t collapse the defense, his shooting is wasted, too.\\n\\nThe solution is obvious: Boban either has to play with Luka (e.g. when KP is on the bench), or he has to play the \"Shaq\" role as the go-to guy against a big mismatch on the 2nd/3rd unit.\\n\\nThe \"regular\" 2nd unit has to play using Kleber in the \"Powell\" P&amp;R role, providing the movement and the lob threat to allow the guards to actually create something.\\n\\nAlso, Burke can\\'t get here soon enough. The Mavs desperately need a dynamic presence on the 2nd unit.',\n",

Try to avoid something that\\'s obvious (\"I bet Luka will score a point\", \"I think that Carlisle looks like Jim Carrey\") but rather things that you see happening but isn\\'t guaranteed, (\"Kleber blocks 2 different players,\" \"Someone hits a buzzer-beater at the end of a quarter\").\\n\\nSometime before the game, I\\'ll collect the top comments as upvoted by you guys and make them into a bingo card. I think the free space will usually be \"Mavs get the W,\" although last year I did make exceptions during special occasions!\\n\\nDuring the game, we\\'ll watch and see if as a subreddit, we can hit Mavs Bingo for the night!\\n\\nCould you guys submit each suggestion as its own individual comment, rather than grouping multiple into 1 comment? I\\'m trying to get a lot of users involved, and so I think it would be best if each suggestion was considered separately.\\n\\nNote on Injured Players: For those people who want to make suggestions involving a player that might be out of the rotation, feel free to add a back-up suggestion in your comment that doesn\\'t involve the player out of the rotation. That way I can use the backup if it\\'s confirmed that your player is out.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested, please feel free to add your comments, and let\\'s have some fun!\\n\\n# LET\\'S GO MAVS!',\n",
